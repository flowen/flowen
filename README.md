### the web is boring af, lets 🌶️ it up

Product/UI/design- & fun-engineer. I enjoy building fast and performant apps. UI, UX, and animation are the topics I love to tinker with, including live visuals in a forgotten past. I'm great with communication and have always been praised for my creativity and pro-activity.
